            <h1 id="myHeader"><em>I started out in Virginia.</h1></em>
    <h4><p>My first job was being a cashier at a FarmFresh.</p>
    <p>I had this deadend job for almost a year, before I realized I needed to move on to better things, better places.. I was determined to move on with my life. <br><br>
    I had a horrible break up about 8 months ago, which prompted me to change and advance in my life. I moved from Virginia Beach to a tiny town in Illinois called Highland, all to come here and learn Code. <br>There were several things I wanted to do aside from code, but my father convinced me that achieving a coding job would give me the means to an end.<br><br><br>

 <br><p>My aspirations had always been to pursue therapy, and as I live through my life I realize I have several aspirations. One of the bigger ones at the moment is to create and sell my own candles and soaps. I feel that it is a good outlet for my artistic side, which I developed over the course of a four year art academy in highschool (back in virginia).</p><br>

 <br>
 <p>Now that I am here and learning, I realize I could easily do coding and my other main aspiration, creating things. I am excited to learn about the possibilities I have in store, and hope to continue growing and evolving until I figure out the perfect way to pursue my life.</p>
